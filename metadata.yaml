description: '"In the field of film aesthetics, it is the first important American
  work, still important--The Art of the Moving Picture is astonishing." --Stanley
  Kauffmann Written in 1915, The Art of the Moving Picture by poet Vachel Lindsay
  is the first book to treat movies as art. Lindsay writes a brilliant analysis of
  the early silent films (including several now lost films). He is extraordinarily
  prescient about the future of moviemaking--particularly about the business, the
  prominence of technology, and the emergence of the director as the author of the
  film. From the Trade Paperback edition.'
